# Instainst

This repo is a personal project.

I want to be able to retrieve daily updates from my kids institution, and present it in a way I see fit.

This system will crawl the posts, store them and eventually present them in an accessible way.

So it's a 100% personal project but feel free to grab anything that would be of any use to you.
